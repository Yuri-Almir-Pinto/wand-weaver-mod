# Spell ideas

- Ancient Flame: Conjure ancient flames (From the beta days) that burns super fast.
- Pocket Dimensions: After reaching the end, gain the capability of acessing an infinite array of pocket dimensions using spells.
- Ethereal Omnitool: After sacrificing a netherite ingot, the player can summon an omni tool that breaks every block up to obsidian at the same speed (stone pick breaking stone block), doesn't have the normal mining cooldown, does 5 damage and completely ignore armor.
- Talisman of Immortality: After sacrificing a totem of immortality, the player can summon a totem of immortality at will. When it pops, it places the player's entire spellcasting into cooldown for some lengthy amount of time.
- Blessing of the Overworld (Or Nostalgia): Grows a tree on the targeted block. The type of the tree can be modified by extension directions.
- Ambrosia: After sacrificing a golden apple, the player can summon an infinite food source called ambrosia. Ambrosia restores hunger indefinitely, but can only restore only up to 2 saturation, making health regeneration slow and requiring the player to constantly eat ambrosia.
- Explosion: A spell which creates an explosion centered on the player. It deals a lot of damage to the player, but has a passive looting effect, and beheads all killed mobs.
- Aqueus: A spell which creates a water source block at the targeted location. The water source block can be used to create infinite water sources.
